#PLEASE NOTE: All code will be executed when the environment is spawned. As such, I'd recommend you encapsulate your functions in a class and use
#the structure as seen in this document for better usability. You don't even have to make them functions, you can just write regular lines of code
#and they will execute.

#MY SECOND LESS IMPORTANT NOTE: Gevvy functions can access other Gevvy functions, they're all in the same scope.
