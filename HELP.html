<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #e0e1dd;">Introduction to GVE</span></h1>
<h2><span style="color: #e0e1dd;">1. What is Gevvy?</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #e0e1dd;">Gevvy (Gusha Virtual Environment or GVE, just sounds like Gevvy to me when I said it aloud) is just like Python's IDLE, except you can have predefined libraries that will be imported on execution of the program and also predefined "functions" that are just pieces of code that execute upon starting the program. You make them yourself and it sounds pretty useless but it's pretty neat; you can use them to predefine classes which can help you better manage your workflow.</span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #e0e1dd;">3. Can my Gevvy function access another Gevvy function?</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #e0e1dd;">Yes! Gevvy functions can access eachother, allowing for collaboration or additions to Gevvy functions from people who choose to use this. If you stick to the layout displayed in my example function in the functions folder that'd be really cool of you. Not required but it'd be nice if you end up sharing your functions.</span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #e0e1dd;">4. What are all these files for?</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #e0e1dd;">"libraries.txt" contains all the predefined libraries. Add or remove whatever libraries you want in there, remember to separate them by putting them on their own line. The folder named "functions" contains a text file with each of our Gevvy functions inside of it. By now you've probably read all about them. If you need more instruction and guidance on these, there's a function called "exampleFunction.txt" that may help clear some confusion.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #e0e1dd;">5. How do I access my functions? How do I use them?</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #e0e1dd;">Whatever you put in the file containing your Gevvy function will just be executed. If you define a class it'll be defined, if you just put a print statement it'll just print. It's nothing revolutionary, if you made a function just call it, anything you input into the terminal is executed in the same scope as all the Gevvy functions.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #e0e1dd;">6. Should I know anything else?</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #e0e1dd;">Please, if you use code in any form that isn't yours, please check it for malicious content. I am NOT responsible for ANY damages: physical, digital, or even emotional if you just love this project of mine so much that it causes attachment issues. If you are of the paranoid type, feel free to read through my code, in fact, I encourage it as I would love to add to this project and improve it. If you have any feedback, feel free to feed it back to me, preferably spoonfed as you tell me "Here comes the airplane!" Thanks.
